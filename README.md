## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations - Project 5 - Deep Reinforcement learning - Teach a Quadcopter how to fly.
# Ricardo Picatoste

This is a second attempt to do the Deep Reinforcement learning. 

I adapted the code from:
https://github.com/yanpanlau/DDPG-Keras-Torcs

The adaptation seems to work properly, but the result is similar to my first attempt, where the agent does not learn how to fly.
